# DVLD – Driving Vehicle License Department (Web App)

## 📌 Overview
The **DVLD Web Application** is an extension of the DVLD system, built to allow **students and teachers** to interact with the Driving License Department online.  
It provides a user-friendly interface where **students can register, log in, book driving lessons, view their history, and calculate fees automatically**, while **teachers can log in to see and manage student appointments**.  

This project was developed to complement the **DVLD Desktop App** and create a complete licensing and scheduling ecosystem.
